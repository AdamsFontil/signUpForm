    <p>Sign up for the 2Chainz newsletter. My favorite rapper when I was in elementary and even middle school for some time.
        He's really dope. Fill out this form to join our discord server and join our community
        where we talk about the good old days. 2Chainz was really the guy back then man,
        the epitome of cool.
