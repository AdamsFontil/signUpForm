I've learned a lot of stuff about CSS before I got to this project. So just in Foundations when I tried to use everything that I learned in my Recipe's site. I plan on doing the same with this sign-up form. None of the of my projects thus far have looked spectacular. I keep saying that the more I learn the better I'd become and be able to improve the design of my sites. And I believe that I think that if I go back to any of my projects I can improve them greatly, especially the UI. The plan is the same once again try my best and apply what I've learned. This is my first project after Foundations and it'd be nice to see to see what I've got.

I just read what I'm suppose to include in a README, and these journal entries aren't really the norm. So this will probably be my last informal and nonchalant README. My other ones will solely focus on describing the project, it's features, future plans for the project not my personal ones. And other things to help explain what the project does, and how the reader can use it.
